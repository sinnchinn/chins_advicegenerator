// random advice generator

// peer reviewer: Bronel Lazar

// comments: The website is spectacular, looks great. The only thing is that the box containing the advice appears to be a little too wide, and there's no mobile resoinsiveness.

// self comments: didn't have time to do the mobile responsiveness, also didn't add a hover to the randomize button. will be working on it over the weekend.
